The attached prompt file contains my completed analysis of the coupon survey dataset. Following the guided investigation for the Bar coupon, I applied the same analytical logic to all other coupon types. For each coupon category, a corresponding set of bar plots was generated to examine the relationship between coupon acceptance rate and various situational factors.

Based on these observations, one representative condition was selected for each coupon type and compared against the overall average acceptance rate. All selected samples have a sample size greater than 30, ensuring statistical reliability. A brief summary of the findings for each coupon type is provided below.
